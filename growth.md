    I feel the growth mindset should be something everyone reads and researches about. Many people including most of my family are set in their ways and are not open to learning new things and changing
themselves for the better when given the opportunity. My father has been working in the restaurant industry for his entire life. Basically, it was the first job he learned and after that he never
branched out and learned another trade. Heck, he still can't read or write English and he has been in this country for 37 years. I found myself in the same industry as him for the last 16 years of my 
life and suddenly I got the desire to better myself. The journey led me to the Iron Yard and I decided it was time for a new challenge in life instead of just enjoying the benefits of the trade I 
learned 16 years ago.
    I truly feel I should have kept the growth mindset throughout my life. When I was younger I tried new things all the time and I embraced new skills. Somewhere around my 20's I became afraid to try,
afraid to fail. I think this happened to a lot of people. Suddenly is you failed at something then it is a big deal. It may have costs you money, time, stress, all these things we didn't have to
consider when we were children going to school with no jobs or responsibility. I find myself at the age of 33 suddenly ready to try, not afraid to fail, if I don't end up as the best back end dev 
on the planet I will not consider it a failure. No matter what I will walk away with more knowledge than I had before and to me that is already a success in itself. It's that mentality I would like
the rest of us adults to find. I found it after a lot of pain and stress. It would be nice if others could find it in an easier fashion than I did. Thank you for reading this as I have a lot to say 
about this topic given the experiences I have had and the family I have.
